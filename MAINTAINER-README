* Building, installing and testing dlvhex-racerplugin

** Prerequisites

See README for all the basic tools and libraries needed in order to
build dlvhex-racerplugin.

The development tools include:

*** flex + bison
This plugin uses relatively new features of flex and bison, so install
the newest versions of these tools. dlvhex-racerplugin was tested with
flex 2.5.33 and bison 2.3. For installation instruction see the
corresponding INSTALL files of the source packages.

*** autotools
The autotools include autoconf, automake and libtool. See the
installation instructions of the corresponding packages.


** Configuration

The `configure' script is being built using the `bootstrap.sh'
script. After its execution, follow the configuration instructions in
the README file.

*** bootstrap.sh
Generates Makefile.in's and the `configure' script with help of the
autotools.

*** Build and compiler flags
You can either globally or locally setup the compiler and compiler
flags. For a package-wide setup set CXX and CXXFLAGS during the
`configure' execution. If you want to do a build with another compiler
or other compiler-flags, set CXX and CXXFLAGS in the `make' run.

**** CXX
Set this variable to the C++ compiler you want to use to build
dlvhex-racerplugin. You can also use this variable to set some
compiler frontends such as `ccache' or `distcc'.

**** CXXFLAGS
Add `-O2' and `-W -Wall' for a descent performance boost and warning
output. For even more pedantic compiler warnings, add `-Weffc++'.


** Build

Invoke `make' to build the plugin. If you want to create a
"self-contained" library with statically linked libraptor, use the
following command:

*** make -C src -e RAPTOR_PATH=/path/to/libraptor libdlvhexracer-static.la
Builds a "self-contained" libdlvhexracer-static.so with a statically
linked libraptor. Use the variable RAPTOR_PATH to tell make the path
to `libraptor.a'.


** Installation

Invoke `make install'.


** Testsuite

Execute `make check' to build an run the testsuite. Make sure there is
no running `RacerPro' instance before you invoke the testsuite. Also
make sure you installed the plugin such that `dlvhex' can find it.


** Cleanup

To clean a build, you can choose from a bunch of cleanup targets of
the automatically generated Makefile's:

*** make clean
Just removes the object files and the plugin, but does not remove the
generated flex scanner and bison parser source code.

*** make -C src maintainer-clean-generic
Invoke this command in the toplevel build directory to remove the flex
scanner and bison parser.

*** make distclean
This target removes the compiled objects and generated Makefiles from
the build directory.

*** make maintainer-clean
This target removes almost everything in the build directory.


* Distributing the plugin

There are two targets for creating a dlvhex-racerplugin package:

** make distcheck
Creates a tarball called dlvhex-racerplugin-VERSION.tar.gz,
configures, builds and invokes the testsuite. Afterwards it runs some
checks on the fresh package. This is the prefered way for creating a
package.

** make dist
Creates the package dlvhex-racerplugin-VERSION.tar.gz.
