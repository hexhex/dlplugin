% Tweety (1) -- The Bird Case     
%
% This is the formulation of the famous "birds fly by default" 
% example from the non-monotonic reasoning literature where 
% Tweety is known to be a bird.
%
% The OWL ontology contains the knowledge about Birds,
% Penguins and Fliers, and that Tweety is a bird; the birds-fly-
% by-default rule is formulated on top of the ontology by
% nonmonotonic rules.
% 
% We then can query whether Tweety flies, and get the intuitive 
% result.
%
% We don't use here strong negation ("-") on LP predicates in rules, 
% since well-founded semantics for dl-programs is only defined-
% in absence of "-". As for answer set semantics, just replace
% "neg_" by "-".

% By default, a bird does not fly:
birds(X) :- &dlC["b.owl", pcbird, mcbird, prbird, mrbird, "Bird"](X).
flies(X) :- birds(X), not neg_flies(X).

% Single out the non-fliers under default assumption:
pcflier("Flier", X) :- flies(X).
neg_flies(X) :- birds(X), &dlC["b.owl", pcflier, mcflier, prflier, mrflier, "-Flier"](X)<fullylinear>.

% Is the description logic KB inconsistent? 
inconsistent :- not &dlConsistent["b.owl", pcflier, mcflier, prflier, mrflier]().
