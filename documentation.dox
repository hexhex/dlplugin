This is a brief overview of the Racer plugin with its components and
 their relationships and information flow.

@defgroup QueryDirector A dl query command

@defgroup RacerInterface The plugin interface

@defgroup DLRewriter The DL Rewriter

@defgroup DLCache The DL Cache

@todo We could store Term objectes more efficiently using some kind of
Term Repository which takes care of objects like
boost::shared_ptr<Term>. All other components like the DLCache could
benefit from such a utility. Maybe we have to adapt the
PluginInterface to use boost::shared_ptr<Term> instead of plain Term
objects.
