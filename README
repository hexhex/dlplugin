* Building and installing dlvhex-racerplugin

** Prerequisites

*** dlvhex
See dlvhex installation instructions.


*** Racer
Download the Racer/RacerPro binary and install it in your favourite
location. dlvhex-racerplugin has been tested with RacerPro 1.8 and
1.9.


*** boost
Follow the instructions of the INSTALL file found in the distributions
tarball. Popular Linux and Unix distributions such as Fedora, Debian,
and NetBSD include pre-built Boost packages.

If you need to build boost by yourself, I suggest using bjam and stow:

$ bjam "--prefix=/install/to/this/dir" "-sTOOLS=gcc" stage
$ bjam "--prefix=/install/to/this/dir/stow/boost-VERSION" "-sTOOLS=gcc" install
$ cd /path/to/stow/dir
$ stow boost-VERSION


*** libraptor
Follow the instructions of the INSTALL file found in the distributions
tarball. dlvhex-racerplugin needs at least libraptor 1.4.8 due to XML
namespace parsing support.


*** cppunit
Follow the instructions of the INSTALL file found in the distributions
tarball. dlvhex-racerplugin has been tested with cppunit 1.10.2 and
1.12.0.


*** flex + bison
dlvhex-racerplugin uses relatively new features of flex and bison, so
install the newest versions of flex + bison. dlvhex-racerplugin was
tested with flex 2.5.33 and bison 2.3. For installation instruction
see the corresponding INSTALL files of the source packages.


** Configuration

*** bootstrap.sh
Generates Makefile.in's and the configure script with help of the
autotools.

*** PKG_CONFIG_PATH
Set this environment variable to the absolute path of dlvhex pkgconfig
directory.

*** RACERPATH
Set this environment variable to the absolute path of the Racer
binary. Defaults to "RacerPro".


** Testing
Run "make check" to build and execute the cppunit-based regression
testsuite.


** Installation
Run "make install" to install dlvhex-racerplugin into a system-wide
plugin directory provided by dlvhex.
